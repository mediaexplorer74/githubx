# GithubX 2.1-alpha - master branch

![Logo](Images/logo.png)

Some Remake ((GithubX2 codename))of old sweet GitIt project... This is my second attempt after 4-5 years, yea!  I decided to port that "old sweetie" from obsolete portable to normal multiplatform one (targets are UWP and, mabe, Android). 

## About R&D
GithubX planned as re-dev (2nd attempt to dev) some simplest retro-client for Windows 10 Mobile retro-os. The point of interest (research): I remembered that 5 years ago GitIt app successfully catches push notifications (ignoring MS "push system/servers" malfunction).. but idk how =)  

## Tech details
- Based on Xamarin multi-platform technology. 
- Targets: UWP, Android
- Min. Win. SDK (for UWP target) : 10240 (Hello, Astoria)
